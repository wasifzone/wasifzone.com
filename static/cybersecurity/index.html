    <h1>Introduction to Cybersecurity</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Wasif Khan</strong>, and I created this page to share some important basics about cybersecurity.</p>

    <p>Cybersecurity is all about protecting computers, networks, and digital data from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. In today's world, almost everything we do is online — from banking to social media — so understanding cybersecurity is very important.</p>

    <p>Some key areas in cybersecurity include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Passwords and Authentication:</strong> Always use strong, unique passwords. Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security.</li>
        <li><strong>Protecting Personal Data:</strong> Avoid sharing sensitive information online. Use encrypted services whenever possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Safe Browsing:</strong> Be careful of suspicious links or websites. They might contain malware that can harm your computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> Keep your operating system and apps updated to protect against new vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Learn to recognize phishing emails, scams, and other cyber threats.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Cybersecurity is not only for experts — everyone, including students and beginners, can practice safe online habits. By understanding the basics, you can protect yourself and your data from hackers and cyber attacks.</p>

    <p>This page is part of my website, and I hope it helps you understand the importance of cybersecurity. Keep learning, stay safe online, and remember that even small steps, like using strong passwords, make a big difference.</p>
